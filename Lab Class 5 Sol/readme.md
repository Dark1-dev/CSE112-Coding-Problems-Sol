1. C++ program to check prime number using user defined function.

2. C++ program to display prime numbers between two intervals using user defined function.

3. Write a function that has one character argument and displays that it’s a small letter, capital
letter, a digit or a special symbol.

4. Write a program that will print Fibonacci series upto n value (using user defined function).

5. Write a C++ program that take four functions that gets two values and returns its sum
,subtraction, multiplication, division using function overloading(data type different).

6. Write a C++ program that take four functions that get integer values and returns its sum,
subtraction, multiplication, division using function overloading (number of argument different).

7. Create a class called “Circle” that calculates and displays the area of a circle. The radius is a
private data member of the class, and the compute_area() function is responsible for computing
and displaying the area based on the given radius. In the main function, create an object of the
Circle class, then display the area of the circle.

8. Create a class called &quot;summation&quot; with the PRIVATE variables number1 and number2. Use a
constructor to initialize these private variables. calculate the sum of these numbers.

9. Create a class called &quot;Rectangle&quot; with the PRIVATE variables length, width. Implement the
constructor to initialize the length and width when an object is created. Implement the
&quot;getArea()&quot; method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
